/* 
 * CSC A48 - Assignment 3 - Ingredient networks
 * 
 * In this assignment, you will practice and strengthen your
 * understanding of graph and recursion. The application 
 * you're working on is a simple network for studying
 * how food ingredients interact. 
 * 
 * This kind of network is the basic model that very
 * powerful systems such as IMB's Watson use as the 
 * basis for creating new combinations of ingredients
 * that are likely to go well together, but haven't been
 * used in previously printed recipes.
 * 
 * Your work here has several components:
 * 
 * - Understanding how the graph is represented by an
 *   adjacency matrix.
 * - Using the adjacency matrix to figure out, given
 *   an input ingredient, what other ingredients it is
 *   related to directly
 * - Using the adjacency matrix to determine, given
 *   a specific ingredient, which others are related
 *   to it directly *and* indirectly by a distance 
 *   of k hops along the graph (k>=1).
 * - Get lits of ingredients that are related, but
 *   not including ingredients from a separate
 *   list of ingredients
 * - *crunchy* Using the adjacency matrix that, given
 *   a recipe (which a list of ingredients) and 
 *   a target ingredient (part of the recipe) to
 *   replace, finds the best replacement from the
 *   remaining ingredients in the graph and updates
 *   the recipe.
 * 
 * This file contains the functions that set up
 * the adjacency matrix and the list of ingredients
 * for you. We provide you with 2 graphs, a 
 * small one with 10 ingredients (and an adjacency
 * matrix of size 10x10), and a full one with 
 * 400 ingredients (adjacency matrix is 400x400).
 * 
 * Use the 10x10 while implementing and testing your
 * solution, and only move to the full-size one once
 * you're confident your code works well.
 * 
 * Select which matrix to use by uncommenting the
 * respective #define statement below.
 * 
 * Sections where you have to implement code are
 * clearly marked
 * ********
 * TO DO:
